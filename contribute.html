                    <p>If you would like to make changes to any of the tutorials on this site or contribute some of your own, this pasge should help you get started.  As this site is hosted on GitHub, contributions are weclome in the form of pull requests.  It is my goal to keep the content of the site consistant, so look to the other tutorials for guidance on how to contstruct any contributions.  Below are some things to keep in mind depending on the type of contribution you'd like to make.</p>

                            <li>If you are unsure whether your idea would be a good fit for the site, open an issue report!</li>
                            <li>Refer to the code of any other tutorial for guidance.  The <a href="./tutorials/pacman.html">pacman tutorial</a> is a good example.</li>
                            <li>If there are any design elements that you would like to use but aren't styled correctly, open an issue report.</li>
