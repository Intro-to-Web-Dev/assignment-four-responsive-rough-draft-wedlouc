                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Pacman is the package manager used by Arch Linux and many of its derivatives.  While it is rightfully praised for its speed and versatility, its somewhat unintuitive command structure may make for a steep learning curve for some users.  In this guide, we will learn some of the most essential pacman commands to get you started.</p>
                    <p>Note that most of these command need to be run as root, so either precede them with sudo, or login as root with the su command.</p>
